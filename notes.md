#### Notes *through November 7, 2020
##### Michigan Specific


- The https://www.mistartmap.info/ site now contains a page with county risk levels for use by schools, local health departments, and long term care facilities: https://mistartmap.info/county_risk_levels
- As of Nov. 4, the State of Michigan saw on average 3391.7 new cases per day and has a 9.5% test positivity. Within the Detroit region, COVID-19 risk is at level D, indicating increased community spread, according to the MI Start Map.
- West Bloomfield School District shifted to a completely remote teaching format for all students after health officials moved Oakland Co. to the COVID-19 risk level E, the highest risk level for COVID-19 risk determination, meaning that there are on average at least 150 cases per million people or 20% or higher test positivity rate in the county.
- Jackson Public Schools has suspended in-person instruction in the past week after a staff member at the high school tested positive for COVID-19. The district is quarantining 10 staff members and 30 students. Quarantined students will remain out of the building until Monday, Nov. 16.
-  The University Record: The University of Michigan announced its Winter 2021 semester plan, urging undergraduate students to remain at home if they have no need to live on campus in order to reduce crowds in residence halls. Undergraduate housing will be relegated to one person per room, and all housing contracts will be canceled for the Winter semester. The university also plans to instate mandatory, weekly COVID-19 testing for all undergraduates on campus, as well as expand surveillance testing capacity for those who are asymptomatic. No course instructor is required to hold in-person instruction if they would rather not do so.



##### Other -- *largely derived from CDC or academic sources*
- An 8th grader from Missouri died last weekend from COVID-19 complications, the state’s youngest death from the illness. His family confirmed his death in a statement from the superintendent of Missouri’s Washington School District, where he attended.

  

- CDC MMWR, Nov 6: Adults who received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to report exclusively going to an office or school setting in the 2 weeks before illness onset, compared with those who tested negative, even among those working in a profession outside of the critical infrastructure.
